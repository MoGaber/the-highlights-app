 Supervised and unsupervised machine learning
Machine Learning is divided into two main areas: supervised learning and unsupervised learning. Although it may seem that the first refers to prediction with human intervention and the second does not, these two concepts are more related with what we want to do with the data. On the other hand, unsupervised learning uses historical data that has no target field. The aim is to explore the data and find some structure or to organize it. For example, it is often used to group customers with characteristics or behaviors similar to those of highly segmented marketing campaigns. An example of classification is the previously mentioned about spam. Emails are “categorized” as “spam” or “legitimate”. Another classic example of classification in the machine learning world is the prediction of churn, for example, in a telecom company. The objective in this case is to detect the behavioral patterns of customers that will be used to predict whether they are going to the competition. In this case, customers are classified as “churn” or “no churn”.
